- A **Ngrok account** for exposing your local Flask server to the internet.

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ConsumeWise.git
```

Once cloned, open the project in **PyCharm**:

- Open PyCharm, go to **File** > **Open**, and select the cloned project folder.

---

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment in PyCharm

1. In PyCharm, go to **File** > **Settings** > **Project: <Your Project Name>** > **Python Interpreter**.
2. Click the gear icon, then select **Add**.
3. Choose **New environment** and select **Virtualenv**.
4. Confirm the creation of the virtual environment by clicking **OK**.

---

### 3. Install Flask and Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is set up, install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

1. Open the terminal in PyCharm.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary Python packages: Flask, Twilio, requests, and Ngrok.

---

### 4. Set Up Twilio WhatsApp

#### Creating a Twilio Account

1. **Sign Up**: Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and click on **Sign up**.
2. **Fill in Details**: Provide the required information (name, email, password).
3. **Email Verification**: Verify your email address.
4. **Account Setup**: Follow the prompts to complete the account setup process.

#### Setting Up the WhatsApp Sandbox

1. **Access the Twilio Console**: Once signed in, navigate to the **Twilio Console**.
2. **Navigate to WhatsApp**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on **Messaging** > **Try It Out** > **WhatsApp Sandbox**.
3. **Join the Sandbox**:
   - Twilio will provide a WhatsApp-enabled number and a **join code**.
   - Add the Twilio number to your WhatsApp contacts.
   - Send a WhatsApp message to that number with the following format:
     ```text
     join your-join-code
     ```

4. **Configure the Twilio Webhook**:
   - In the **WhatsApp Sandbox Settings**, under the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** field, you will paste the Ngrok forwarding URL (to be done later).

---

### 5. Run Ngrok

Ngrok allows you to expose your local Flask application to the internet.

#### Creating a Ngrok Account

1. **Sign Up**: Go to [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and click on **Sign up**.
2. **Fill in Details**: Provide the required information (name, email, password).
3. **Download Ngrok**: After signing up, download Ngrok from [Ngrok's website](https://ngrok.com/download).
4. **Install Ngrok**: Extract the downloaded file and place it in a convenient directory.

#### Step 1: Start Ngrok

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to expose your Flask app running on `localhost:5000` to the internet:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

   Ngrok will provide a forwarding URL that looks like this:

   ```text
   http://abcd1234.ngrok.io
   ```

#### Step 2: Complete Twilio Webhook Setup

1. Copy the **Ngrok forwarding URL** from the terminal.
2. Go back to the **Twilio Console** > **WhatsApp Sandbox Settings**.
3. Paste the Ngrok forwarding URL in the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** field, appending `/whatsapp` at the end:

   ```text
   http://abcd1234.ngrok.io/whatsapp
   ```

---

### 6. Run the Flask Application

To start the Flask application, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in PyCharm.
2. Run the Flask app by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will start the Flask server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

### 7. Interact with the Bot

With everything set up, you can now interact with the bot:

1. Open WhatsApp and send a message (e.g., "Hello") to the Twilio number.
2. The bot will respond with a welcome message and guide you through creating a health profile or searching for a product.

---

## Working of the Bot

The bot functions through a combination of Flask webhooks and Twilio’s messaging service for WhatsApp. Here's how the interaction works:

1. **User Sends a Message**:
   - When a user sends a message to the WhatsApp bot (via Twilio), the message is forwarded to the Flask server through the webhook endpoint `/whatsapp`.

2. **Flask Processes the Message**:
   - The bot identifies the message type (text or command) and triggers appropriate responses.
   - Example: When the user sends "Hello," the bot recognizes it as an initiation and responds with a greeting.

3. **Health Profile Setup**:
   - The bot asks for the user’s health information such as diabetes or allergies.
   - The user's responses are stored in memory (or a database), and the bot uses this information to personalize future recommendations.

4. **Product Search**:
   - When a user submits a product’s barcode, the bot queries a database or external API (like Open Food Facts) to fetch details about the product.
   - The bot compares the product’s ingredients and nutritional information against the user’s health profile to check for potential allergens or health risks.

5. **Allergy Alerts & Nutritional Warnings**:
   - If the product contains allergens that the user has mentioned, the bot issues an allergy alert.
   - Similarly, the bot provides nutritional warnings based on the user’s health profile, such as flagging high sugar levels for diabetic users.

6. **Claim Verification**:
   - The bot can analyze claims like “sugar-free” or “natural” by looking up the product’s ingredients and verifying whether the claim is accurate or misleading.

7. **Bot Response**:
   - The bot generates a response message with the analysis results and sends it back to the user via WhatsApp.

---

## Usage

1. **Create a Health Profile**:
   - Provide information about your health conditions.
   - Example:
     ```text
     Do you have diabetes? (yes/no): yes
     Do you have any allergies? (yes/no): yes
     Enter any allergies you have: peanuts, milk
     ```

2. **Search for Products by Barcode**:
   - Enter a product’s barcode to get detailed health-related information.
   - Example:
     ```text
     Enter the product barcode: 8906009501017
     ```

3. **Check Misleading Claims**:
   - Provide the product barcode and a claim (e.g., "sugar-free") to check its validity.
   - Example:
     ```text
     Enter the claim to analyze: sugar-free
     ```
     
---

## Detailed Twilio Setup

1. **Sign Up for Twilio**: Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and create an account.
2. **Configure WhatsApp Sandbox**:
   - Go to **Messaging** > **Try It Out** > **WhatsApp Sandbox**.
   - Add the provided WhatsApp-enabled number and send the **join code** via WhatsApp.
3. **Set the Webhook**: Once you have the Ngrok URL, paste it into the **WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN** field in the **WhatsApp Sandbox Settings**, appending `/whatsapp`.

---

## Ngrok Setup

1. **Install Ngrok**: Download it from [Ngrok’s website](https://ngrok.com/download) and extract it.
2. **Expose Flask on Port 5000**: Run the following command to expose your Flask app:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```
3. In **Resources** folder there is a [ngrok.exe](Resources/ngrok.exe) file present for system installation of ngrok.  

---

## Flask Route Explanation

In the `main.py` file, the Flask application defines the following routes:

- **/whatsapp**: Receives incoming messages from WhatsApp and processes them.
- **/health**:

 Handles user health profile creation.
- **/product-search**: Manages product lookup by barcode.

---

## Requirements

- Flask
- Twilio
- Requests
- Ngrok

The required packages for this project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **Twilio Webhook**: Ensure that the Ngrok URL is correctly set in the Twilio Console.
- **Ngrok**: Check that Ngrok is running and forwarding requests to `localhost:5000`.
- **Flask App**: Make sure the Flask application is running without errors.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-language Support**: Adding support for more languages to reach a wider audience.
- **Product Database Expansion**: Integrating with multiple food databases for a more comprehensive product analysis.
